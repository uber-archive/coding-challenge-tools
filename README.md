Web Coding Challenge
====================

Here is a sample project that will give us some insight into your current level
of experience.

This is a simple project, but please organize, design, test and document your
code as if it were going into production. Please then send us:

* A link to the hosted application
* A link to the hosted repository (e.g. Github/Bitbucket)
* Any other example of code you're particularly proud of.
* Your resume or link to public profile

Functional spec
---------------

Prototype **one of** the following projects.

Spend as much time as you like on this project. However, out of respect for your
time, if you need to scope it to 3-4 hours, feel free to mock/fake any feature
that you don't have time to develop.

The UX/UI is totally up to you. Feel free to explain any assumptions you have to
make. If you like, get creative and add additional features a user might find
useful!

While visual design is not part of the challenge, a polished interface is
preferred.

### Departure times

Create a web app that gives real-time departure time for public transportation
(use freely available public API). The app should geolocalize the user.

Here are some examples of freely available data:

* [511](http://511.org/developer-resources_transit-api.asp) (San Francisco)
* [Nextbus](http://www.nextbus.com/xmlFeedDocs/NextBusXMLFeed.pdf) (San
  Francisco)

### SF Movies

Create a web app that shows where movies have been filmed in San
Francisco. The user should be able to filter the view using 
autocompletion search.

The data is available on [DataSF](http://www.datasf.org/): [Film
Locations](https://data.sfgov.org/Arts-Culture-and-Recreation-/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am).

### Bicycle Parking

Create a web app providing directions to the nearest bicycle parking.

The data is available on [DataSF](http://www.datasf.org/): [Bicycle
Parking](https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Bicycle-Parking-Public-/w969-5mn4) 

### Food trucks

Create a web app that tells the user what types of food trucks
might be found near a specific location.

The data is available on [DataSF](http://www.datasf.org/): [Food
Trucks](https://data.sfgov.org/Permitting/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat) 

Technical spec
--------------

Split your architecture between a back-end and a web front-end, for instance
providing a JSON in/out RESTful API. Feel free to use any other technologies
provided that the general client/service architecture is respected.

### Back-end

We believe there is no one-size-fits-all technology. Good engineering is also
about using the right tool for the right job. A big part of what we do is
learning new tools and technologies. Therefore, feel free to mention in your
README how much experience you have with the technical stack you choose, we
will take note of that when reviewing your challenge.

Here are some technologies we are more familiar with:

* **Python** (most of our back-end uses this language)
* JavaScript
* Ruby
* PHP
* Go
* C++
* Haskell

You are also free to use any web framework, although we would prefer that you 
use a microframework (e.g. [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)).

### Front-end

The front-end should ideally be a "one page app" with a single `index.html`
linking to external JS/CSS/etc. You may take this opportunity to demonstrate
your CSS3 or HTML5 knowledge.

We recommend using [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/)
for front-end MVC.

Host it!
--------

When you’re done, host it somewhere and provide us with the server's URL, as
well as a Github/Bitbucket URL for the repo hosting your code.
